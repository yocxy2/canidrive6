#!/bin/sh
# Starts as root, normalizes the bind-mounted Docker socket's group
# ownership so the unprivileged `floci` user can reach it on any host,
# then re-executes this script as `floci` via gosu. The second invocation
# falls through to exec the user's command.
#
# Why: on native Linux Docker, /var/run/docker.sock is owned by
# root:docker with mode 660 and the docker GID varies by distro. On
# Docker Desktop (macOS/Windows) the socket is typically root:root (GID
# 0). Without the group fix-up below, floci (uid 1001, group 0) can open
# the socket on Docker Desktop but not on native Linux — which breaks
# ECR, Lambda, and RDS service emulation there. Discovering the GID at
# runtime handles every host transparently.
